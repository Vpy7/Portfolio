This project develops a recommendation system for electric vehicles (EVs) that personalizes suggestions based on user-defined inputs. Users specify numeric and categorical vehicle attributes via an interactive interface, which are then processed through data transformation and similarity calculations to find the most comparable EVs from the dataset.
