This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing hand gestures from the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors, combining both classification and object detection tasks. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained to predict not only the gesture class but also the bounding box that localizes the hand in the image.
