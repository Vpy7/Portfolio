## Classification
### [Store Membership Renewal](https://nbviewer.org/github/Vpy7/Jupyter-Analysis-Collection/blob/f81a091db4e1921072158948bd860d08361f1d00/Classification/Store%20Membership%20Renewal/Membership%20groceries%20store%20user%20profile%20Dataset.ipynb)  

This project focuses on analyzing annual behavioral data of members from a membership-based grocery store in China (2024) to predict membership auto-renewal and design targeted retention strategies. The dataset includes variables such as shopping frequency, app engagement, promotions usage, and customer demographics. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns, build a predictive model, and derive actionable insights to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.

## Clustering

### [Teen Psychology Clustering](https://nbviewer.org/github/Vpy7/Jupyter-Analysis-Collection/blob/f81a091db4e1921072158948bd860d08361f1d00/Classification/Store%20Membership%20Renewal/Membership%20groceries%20store%20user%20profile%20Dataset.ipynb)  

Teen mental health is a growing concern in an increasingly digital and high-pressure world. The "Inside Teen Minds" dataset offers a detailed simulation of daily mood, stress levels, habits, and digital behavior among high school students across more than 40 countries in 2025. This project uses clustering techniques to explore patterns in the mental health and lifestyle behaviors of teens. The goal is to identify distinct behavioral profiles and gain insights into how daily habits and technology use relate to emotional well-being.

### [Teen Psychology Clustering: Second Approach](https://nbviewer.org/github/Vpy7/Jupyter-Analysis-Collection/blob/f81a091db4e1921072158948bd860d08361f1d00/Classification/Store%20Membership%20Renewal/Membership%20groceries%20store%20user%20profile%20Dataset.ipynb)  

Teen mental health is a growing concern in an increasingly digital and high-pressure world. 

UMAP is performed with n_neighbours=20 and n_components=35.

Then, Gaussian Mixture, Spectral Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN are performed for a cluster range of 2 to 12. For each one, Silhouette Score is computed.
