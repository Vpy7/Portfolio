This project focuses on analyzing annual behavioral data of members from a membership-based grocery store in China (2024) to predict membership auto-renewal and design targeted retention strategies. The dataset includes variables such as shopping frequency, app engagement, promotions usage, and customer demographics. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns, build a predictive model, and derive actionable insights to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.
